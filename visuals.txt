Random visuals that would make our project cooler (also boring visuals that we have to do):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
• A scatter plot showing the mean rentals of AirBnBs in each neighbourhood, with each point located according to the mean location of AirBnBs in that neighbourhood

• Histograms for each data field to check for normality

• Screenshots before/after cleaning

• Correlation coefficients for all the variables (bonus points if its colored and stuff)

• Think of some other cool stuff do add
